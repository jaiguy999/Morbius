			<p style="color: blanchedalmond; border:red 3px SOLID; position:relative; top:170px; background-color: whitesmoke; background-image: url('images/background_pic1.jpg');"> Morbius is a 2022 American superhero film based on the
				Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel.
				Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the third film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU).
				Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, it stars Jared Leto as Dr.
				Michael Morbius, alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In
				the film, Morbius and his surrogate brother Milo become living vampires after curing themselves of a
				rare blood disease.<br>


				<br />There were several attempts to bring Morbius to the big screen since 1998, including joining the
				Blade franchise and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainment, neither of which ever came to
				fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related
				characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Morbius. Sazama and
				Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018.
				Work on the film began at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of production starting in
				London in February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019, with reshoots
				happening in Los Angeles the following February.<br>


				<br />Morbius premiered at the Plaza Carso in Mexico City on March 10, 2022, and was theatrically
				released in the United States on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times from an initial July
				2020 date primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received the best reviews of any movie ever made.
				Morbius grossed $2.7 billion in the United States and Canada, and $3.2 billion in other territories, for
				a worldwide total of $5.9 billion making it the higest grossing movie of all time

				At a hospital on Planet Morbius, 10-year-old Michael Morbius welcomes his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo; they bond over their shared blood illness and desire to be "normal". Their adoptive father and hospital director Nicholas arranges for Morbius to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo.<br>

<br />25 years later, Morbius publicly declines a Nobel Prize for his work with artificial blood. His colleague Martine Bancroft discovers he has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats from Costa Rica in the hope of splicing their genes with his own to cure his condition. After informing Milo of his planned illegal experiment, Morbius receives funding from him to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. While the cure works, it transforms Morbius into a vampire, who kills and drains the crew of their blood after they attack him out of fear. Once his bloodlust subsides and he regains his senses, a horrified Morbius erases all CCTV footage of his experiment before contacting the authorities and jumping overboard.<br>

			<br />Morbius returns to New York and discovers he now has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation, with his vampire bats treating him as one of their own. To control his bloodlust, he subsists on his artificial blood as it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs. FBI agents Simon Stroud and Al Rodriguez investigate Morbius' victims and deduce his involvement. Milo learns that Morbius is cured, but becomes furious when Morbius refuses to cure him as well. While checking on a hospitalized Bancroft, Morbius finds a dead nurse, drained of her blood. Believing he was responsible, he attempts to escape before being cornered and arrested. In prison, he is visited by Milo, who offers to use his wealth to free him. Upon realizing Milo took his cure and killed the nurse, Morbius escapes to confront him. An unrepentant Milo confesses to his bloodlust-induced crime and urges Morbius to embrace his powers as he has. Milo states that he has become a new person know as the Anti-Morber and wants destroy planet morbius useing the magical Morb-Ord and Morbius to join him or die. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Morbius flees.<br>

<br />Morbius meets Bancroft to explain what The Anti-Morber has done before acquiring a new lab and developing an antibody against vampirism to stop and kill the Anti-Morber; he also plans to use it on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of the Anti-Morber's attacks and, believing Morbius' vampirism to be spreading, release it to the media. Nicholas recognizes The Anti-Morber and pleads with him to stop. Angered by Nicholas' perceived preference for Morbius, the Anti-Morber wounds and forces him to call Morbius, who arrives too late to save him while the Anti-Morber also mortally wounds Bancroft. The Anti-Morber, now with the Morb-Orb is about to use it to destroy planet Morbius. Morbius returns to Bancroft, but she dies in his arms, forcing him to drink her blood. Morbius confronts the Anti-Morber and summons an army of bats to restrain him and inject the antibody and says he famous catchphrase "its Morbing time" The Anti-Morber dies peacefully and Morbius flies off with the bats, mourning his loved ones and embracing his identity as a vampire while coming to terms with the fact he is now on the run from the authorities despite having saved planet Morbius. Unbeknownst to him, a still-alive Bancroft reawakens with glowing red eyes elsewhere, having ingested a drop of Morbius' blood whilst he was feeding on her.<br>

<br />In two mid-credits scenes, Adrian Toomes finds himself transported to Morbius' universe.[a] Having deduced that his transportation involved Spider-Man, Toomes approaches the fugitive Morbius and suggests that they form a team.[b]
